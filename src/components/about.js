          Growing up in Science is a conversation series 
          featuring personal narratives of becoming and being a scientist.
          <br/><br/>
          Growing up in Science was started in 2014 at New York University by 
          professors Wei Ji Ma and Cristina Alberini, and is now worldwide.

            This article
          </a> describes the origin and impact of the series. 
          
          At a typical Growing up in Science event, one faculty member 
          shares their life story, with a focus on struggles, failures, doubts, 
          detours, and weaknesses. Common topics include dealing with expectations, 
          impostor syndrome, procrastination, luck, rejection, conflicts with advisors, 
          and work-life balance, but these topics are always embedded in the speaker's broader narrative.
          <br/><br/>
          Join us for a conversation about the human factors that are 
          universal undercurrents of working in academia but that 
          too often remain unspoken.
